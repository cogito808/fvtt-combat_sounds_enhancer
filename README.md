# fvtt-combat_sounds_enhancer
Add sounds to various elements of combat.
****This is probably a hot mess of AI Slop but I needed something to replace some unmaintained modules. Tested on FVTT 13 and PF2E. Feel free to make better. ***
•	Create a "Combat Starts" playlist to play a random track when combat begins.
•	Create a "Hype Tracks" playlist for player-assigned characters; these tracks play at the start of each turn.
•	Create a "Death Sounds" playlist for NPC defeat events.
•	Create a "Critical Success" and "Critical Fail" playlists for matching critical rolls in PF2E (use probably have Midi in D&D).
